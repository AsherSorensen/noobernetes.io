## Introduction
This repo contains a sample sinatra application to illustrate how to deploy a simple application to Kubernetes. It will cover:
- Docker basics: building, pushing and interacting with docker images
- Kubernetes basics: writing Deployments and Services and interacting with a Kubernetes cluster
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling: using Kubernetes to scale a deployment based on CPU usage

## About
These tutorials were made as I was trying to learn Kubernetes for use at [Mavenlink](www.mavenlink.com) and as an example for a talk given to the [Women Level Up](http://womenlevelup.com/) meetup. I hope to add more to it as I continue to explore Kubernetes. PRs welcome!
